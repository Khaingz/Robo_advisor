# Robo_advisor
Challenge15

# Description

In this challenge I’ve been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I have to decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

This challenge is divided into three sections:

 - Step 1: Configure the Initial Robo Advisor

     - Create the robo advisor bot and add an intent with its corresponding slots.
     
 - Step 2: Build and Test the Robo Advisor

      - Build and test the robo advisor. A screen recording is provided in the 'screen_recordings' folder that demonstrates this.
      
 - Step 3: Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function

      - Create an Amazon Lambda function to validate the data that a user supplies during a conversation with the robo advisor. The Lambda function (lambda_function.py) is located in the 'Lambda' folder located in this repository.
      
      - A screen recording is provided in the 'screen_recordings' folder to demonstrates how this works.
